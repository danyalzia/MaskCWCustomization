# Behavioral Imprint-synced Faceplate Cyberware Customization

## Introduction

Have you noticed how underwhelming this Cyberware is with that awfully long cooldown (1500s at Tier 5... seriously?) after you figured out you can actually remove up to 4 police stars with it? With this mod, you can customize certain features of this Cyberware to make it actually viable without resorting to simple cheats for preventing the police (and make yourself feel badass).

Right now I chose the current default values:

Tier 5 Cooldown = 1500s -> 25s
Tier 5+ Cooldown = 600s -> 15s
Tier 5++ Cooldown = 300s -> 5s
Deactivate Prevention Up To Five Stars = false
Allow In Combat = false

More customization features will come!

Note: I looked at this mod when searching for similar idea, but I don't think that mod is working because those records are outdated in the latest game version.

## Installation

1. Copy both "bin" and "r6" to your "\Cyberpunk 2077\" game folder.
2. Configure the settings in "Mods" menu under tab "Mask CW".
3. Reload the last save if you are already in game after changing the settings to ensure that all settings are applied correctly.

The files will be located under the following directories:
```
\Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods\MaskCWCustomization
```
```
\Cyberpunk 2077\r6\scripts\MaskCWCustomization
````
